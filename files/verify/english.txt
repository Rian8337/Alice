Welcome to the verification channel!

To verify yourself as someone who plays osu!droid or interested in the game and open the rest of the server, you can follow any of the following methods:

```md
- post an osu!droid screenshot (main menu if you are an online player or a score if you are an offline player). If you've just created an osu!droid account, please submit a score to the account before verifying

- post a screenshot of your osu! profile (or link it) and state your reason for joining this server
```
after that, you can ping the @Moderator and/or @Helper role in your thread and wait for one to come to verify you.
