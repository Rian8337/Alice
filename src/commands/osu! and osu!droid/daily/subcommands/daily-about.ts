You can get points and ${coin}Alice coins by passing the challenge. There will be a few bonuses that allows you to gain more points and ${coin}Alice coins, too! Each challenge bonus level converts to 2 challenge points, which also converts to ${coin}\`4\` Alice coins.\n\nThe weekly bounty challenge, which is only available once per week, grants more points and ${coin}Alice coins as this challenge is considerably harder than any daily challenges. That's also why you have a week to complete it, too!`)
